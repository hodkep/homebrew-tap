  caveats <<~EOS
    Agent World is not signed with an Apple Developer ID yet. So that it opens without macOS's
    "Open Anyway" step, this cask removes the quarantine mark macOS puts on downloaded apps from
    Agent World.app. That skips macOS's first-launch check for this app only. Install the dmg from
    the release page instead if you want that check:
